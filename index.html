We didn't do that because governments said that we should, but because we knew that these protective measure were, for some, the difference between life and death.<br><br>Imagie what we could achieve in averting ecological collapse if we were to design and implement <br>such protective measures collectively. Prioritising only those things as a society now that are absolutely necasary to ensure our common survival.<br><strong><br></strong><strong>What do you hold dear?<br></strong><strong>What are you prepared to let go? </strong><br><strong>What might those protective measures be?  <br></strong><br></p>

                    While those of us more fortunate worked from home, many had little choice but to carry on working, the health workers, shelf stackers, firefighters, bus drivers had to put themsleves at risk to provide us all with the basics. Often with indequate protective measure in place.&nbsp;<br><br>With the Black Lives Matter movement in the US, triggered by the brutal murder of Geroge Floyd, bringing the violent face of racism to the fore at a global level, statistics show that globaly people of colour globaly are much more likely to live in poverty and be impacted by not only the virius but also polutions, dirty and water. <br><br>It's the same undercurrent of racism that allows us to convieninty ignore the exploitation of black and brown bodies and the poor in the global south in order to steal the resources on which the obcsene wealth of a handfull of elites in the global north is built. &nbsp;</p>

This represents an important opportunity for social movements to move beyond a process of reacting to the COP and put in place a bottom up process to challaneg head on the private interests goverened.&nbsp;</p>

The <em>covid19 pandemic </em>has forced governments to use one of the most importatn powers they have to create money in order to bailout companies that would have otherwise gone bust. So far 1.2 trillion euros of new money has been created in the form of stimulus and resuce packages. For individuals and small to medium size busnessess the conditions have been strict and harsh, the money given in the form of loans. For the multinationals the handouts have largely come with no conditions whatsoever and in the form of bailoutsm with no need to be paid back. &nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><a data-app-prevent-settings="" class="carousel-control carousel-control-prev" role="button" data-slide="prev" href="#slider1-1"><span aria-hidden="true" class="mbri-left mbr-iconfont"></span><span class="sr-only">Previous</span></a><a data-app-prevent-settings="" class="carousel-control carousel-control-next" role="button" data-slide="next" href="#slider1-1"><span aria-hidden="true" class="mbri-right mbr-iconfont"></span><span class="sr-only">Next</span></a></div></div>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-white pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-5">Is building a radical coaliton of organisations, caoolecing around climate justice and civil disobedience. That is important work that we fully support and are actively engaging with. BUT the focus on infrastructure shut down will always have limited reach and over the last 10 years, while achieveing alot, it hasn't been enough to trigger the system level shift that we must aim for.&nbsp;<br><br>The peoples agreement is quite different, but complimentary, to the Glasgow Agreement. Whereas the GA aims to engage groups in establishing the target of direct actions using the primary tool of civil disobedience. The Peoples agreement aims to engage communities in establishing the building blocks for collective political organising to build out the solutions and vision that is so desperately needed.&nbsp;</h3>
